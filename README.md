# polymax Forward Ledger

[![forward hit rate](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpolymax-income.vercel.app%2Fbadge.json)](https://polymax-income.vercel.app/track-record/)

Every position the [polymax engine](https://polymax-income.vercel.app) has taken on
Polymarket, settled against the market's actual on-chain outcome. **Losses included,
always.** Backtests can be tuned; a forward ledger cannot.

## Why this repo exists

The ledger is published as canonical JSON and fingerprinted daily — past fingerprints
are never edited. This repo's **commit history is an independent witness**: rewriting a
past day's hash would show up as a rewritten commit for the world to see.

## Verify it yourself

```bash
curl -s https://polymax-income.vercel.app/ledger/ledger.json | shasum -a 256
# compare with data/hashes.json (latest entry) — and with this repo's history
```

Every verdict carries its Polymarket `conditionId`, so each outcome is independently
checkable on-chain.
